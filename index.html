		<p>My blog is usually hosted on <a href="https://sr.ht">sourcehut</a>, which is down right now.

		<p>I guess that's one of the disadvantages of not hosting on bigger websites :(

		<p>Unfortunately I'm travelling and my backups are at home. Once I get back I'll upload them here, or hopefully sourcehut will come back online first.

		<p>Some of the site is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231225100251/https://kvakil.me/">archived on the Wayback Machine</a>.
