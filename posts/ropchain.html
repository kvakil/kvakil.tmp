while ASLR+DEP+stack canaries are enabled. As a reminder, here’s how the
code looks:</p>

    gets(door);
}

    deja_vu();

here.</a></p>
<h1 id="aslr-and-dep">ASLR and DEP</h1>
<p>We will start by defeating ASLR and DEP. The text segment of our dejavu
binary will not be randomized, since it is not a position-independent
executable. This means we can get around both defenses with a return
oriented programming chain. Our solution is broken up into many
different steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Put the address of the system function from libc onto the stack.</li>
<li>Put the address of the string <code>"s/kernel/rtsig-max"</code> onto the stack
(but possibly far from system).</li>
<li>Align the stack pointer to point to <code>"s/kernel/rtsig-max"</code>.</li>
<li>Align <code>edx</code> to point to &amp;system.</li>
<li>Call <code>[edx]</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is equivalent to <code>system("s/kernel/rtsig-max")</code>, which executes an
attacker-controlled binary with setuid privileges. The string
<code>"s/kernel/rtsig-max"</code> is mostly arbitrary, any string contained in libc
which can be treated as a relative Linux path and ends whose address
ends in a NUL byte is a valid target.</p>
<p>It’s possible to get the string <code>"/bin/sh"</code> on the stack instead, but
that makes our attack more complicated.</p>
<h1 id="return-oriented-programming-primer">Return Oriented Programming Primer</h1>
<p>The idea behind return oriented programming is that you place the
addresses of “gadgets” onto the stack. These gadgets do some (usually
small) operation, and then call <code>ret</code>. Once we <code>ret</code>, that pops the
address of the next gadget off the stack and jumps to that address. Our
goal is to chain these small gadgets together in order to achieve
arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p>Effectively, we can think of ROP as letting us jump to any series of
addresses we want, as long as the calls doesn’t mess up our stack. Usual
suspects for messing up the stack is a <code>leave</code> or anything which changes
<code>esp</code> by a lot.</p>
<p>There are tools to help find gadgets within executables. This is useful,
because sometimes gadgets can even be hidden <em>inside</em> other
instructions! Let’s run
<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget">ROPgadget</a> to see what
sort of gadgets we have.</p>
<pre><code>    $ python ROPgadget.py --binary ../dejavu --badbytes 0a
    # ...
    Unique gadgets found: 86</code></pre>
<p>We set a “bad byte” of 0x0a since we know that our gets function cannot
write a newline. (It can write NUL bytes.) While we have a bunch of
gadgets, most of them <strong>suck</strong>. Here are the few that we plan to use:</p>
<pre><code>    0x0804841c : dec ecx ; ret
    0x0804835e : add dh, bl ; ret
    0x0804857b : call dword ptr [edx]
    0x080482d2 : pop ebx ; ret
    0x080482bb : ret</code></pre>
<p>Note that the last of these gadgets is effectively a return oriented
programming NOP: it just moves the <code>esp</code> up 4 bytes to access the next
return address. We’ll see later why it is useful.</p>
<h1 id="the-attack">The Attack</h1>
<p>We will need to reference the disassembly quite often. Here is the
disassembly of the dejavu program, excluding libc parts.</p>
<pre><code>    deja_vu:
       0x0804840c &lt;+0&gt;:         push   ebp
       0x0804840d &lt;+1&gt;:         mov    ebp,esp
       0x0804840f &lt;+3&gt;:         sub    esp,0x28
       0x08048412 &lt;+6&gt;:         lea    eax,[ebp-0x10]
       0x08048415 &lt;+9&gt;:         mov    DWORD PTR [esp],eax
       0x08048418 &lt;+12&gt;:        call   0x80482f0 &lt;gets@plt&gt;
       0x0804841d &lt;+17&gt;:        leave  
       0x0804841e &lt;+18&gt;:        ret   
    main:
       0x0804841f &lt;+0&gt;:         push   ebp
       0x08048420 &lt;+1&gt;:         mov    ebp,esp
       0x08048422 &lt;+3&gt;:         and    esp,0xfffffff0
       0x08048425 &lt;+6&gt;:         call   0x804840c &lt;deja_vu&gt;
       0x0804842a &lt;+11&gt;:        mov    eax,0x0
       0x0804842f &lt;+16&gt;:        leave  
       0x08048430 &lt;+17&gt;:        ret    </code></pre>
<p>Let’s take a look at the stack layout at <code>deja_vu+18</code> (right before we
<code>ret</code> from the function). It looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>    /---------------------\
    |        . . .        |
    |  saved return addr. |  &lt;--- esp
    |        . . .        |
    |        door         |  &lt;--- eax, edx
    |        . . .        |
    |        . . .        |
    |        . . .        |
    |      libc_end       |  &lt;--- ecx
    |        . . .        |
    |       system        |  &lt;--- we want this
    |        . . .        |
    |     libc_start      |  &lt;--- ebx
    |        . . .        |
    |        . . .        |
    |        . . .        |
    |    dejavu .text     |
    \---------------------/</code></pre>
<p>Even though libc’s position in code is randomized, <code>ebx</code> and <code>ecx</code>
effectively “leak” information about its location. This is a result of
the dynamic loader resolving the call to <code>gets@plt</code>. How this occurs is
a little complicated, so let’s take it for granted.</p>
<p>While the address of libc is randomized by ASLR, the offset of things
within libc is not. For example, the system function is always at
0x168494 bytes before <code>libc_end</code>. We want to call this function, so we
need to decrease <code>ecx</code> by 0x168494.</p>
<p>How can we decrease <code>ecx</code>? We do have a promising gadget which
decrements <code>ecx</code> by 1:</p>
<pre><code>    0x0804841c : dec ecx ; ret</code></pre>
<p>We would need to call this gadget 0x168494 times to get the address of
system. (There are no other useful gadgets for either <code>ecx</code> or <code>ebx</code>.)
Our available stack space is an order of magnitude less.</p>
<p>However, we can use the following trick: we return to main. Because gcc
aligns the stack at 16 bytes intervals, we will gain stack space every
time we call main. The picture below illustrates the scenario right
before main+3 executes:</p>
<pre><code>    /---------------------\
    |        . . .        |
    |       4 bytes       |  &lt;--- old esp
    |         sfp         |  &lt;--- esp, ebp
    |       4 bytes       |
    |       4 bytes       |
    |       4 bytes       |  &lt;--- esp &amp; 0xfffffff0
    |        . . .        |
    \---------------------/</code></pre>
<p>After we call main, our program continues to call <code>deja_vu</code>. This gives
us another opportunity to do a buffer overflow to gain more stack space.
By repeating this method a bunch of times, we can get enough stack space
to do 0x168494 decrements. We need to perform all the decrements at once
since our value for <code>ecx</code> gets overwritten every time <code>gets</code> is called.</p>
<p>We perform the same method in order to get the address of
<code>"s/kernel/rtsig-max"</code> onto the stack.</p>
<p>Once we have <code>ecx</code> pointing to system, we now need to call the address.
There is a call gadget <code>call dword ptr [edx]</code>. So we need some way to
get the address of the value of <code>ecx</code> into <code>edx</code>. The only place where
we have the opportunity to put <code>ecx</code> on the stack is a <code>push ecx</code> in
<code>_start</code>. The <code>_start</code> function is called by the operating system before
main and effectively loads libc which then begins the main program.</p>
<pre><code>    _start:
       0x08048320 &lt;+0&gt;:     xor    ebp,ebp
       0x08048322 &lt;+2&gt;:     pop    esi
       0x08048323 &lt;+3&gt;:     mov    ecx,esp
       0x08048325 &lt;+5&gt;:     and    esp,0xfffffff0
       0x08048328 &lt;+8&gt;:     push   eax
       0x08048329 &lt;+9&gt;:     push   esp
       0x0804832a &lt;+10&gt;:  push   edx
       0x0804832b &lt;+11&gt;:  push   0x80484b0
       0x08048330 &lt;+16&gt;:  push   0x8048440
       0x08048335 &lt;+21&gt;:  push   ecx
       0x08048336 &lt;+22&gt;:  push   esi
       0x08048337 &lt;+23&gt;:  push   0x804841f
       0x0804833c &lt;+28&gt;:  call   0x8048310 &lt;__libc_start_main@plt&gt;
       0x08048341 &lt;+33&gt;:  hlt    </code></pre>
<p>In order to have the program run correctly and to push <code>ecx</code> on the
stack, we need to jump to <code>_start+9</code>. We could actually jump to anywhere
between <code>_start+5</code> and <code>_start+11</code>, but this will mess up our stack
alignment later on.</p>
<p>Recall that the return value of gets is stored in <code>edx</code>. We can use some
arithmetic in order to get that <code>edx</code> to point one of the system calls.
We do have a gadget which involves arithmetic using <code>edx</code> and <code>ebx</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    0x0804835e : add dh, bl ; ret</code></pre>
<p>If you need a reminder of how x86 registers work, look at the following
diagram.</p>
<pre><code>    /------------------------\
    |          edx           |
    |           |     dx     |
    |           |  dh  |  dl |
    \------------------------/</code></pre>
<p>The register <code>edx</code> refers to the whole 32-bit register. The register
<code>dx</code> refers to the lower 16-bits of the register. <code>dh</code> and <code>dl</code> refer to
the two 8-bit halves of the lower 16-bits. So this gadget lets us change
the middle bits of <code>edx</code> however we want. Note we can’t “overflow” <code>dh</code>
into the top half of the register, so we cannot actually affect the top
bits of <code>edx</code>.</p>
<p>There is also a gadget letting us pop into <code>ebx</code>, so we completely
control <code>bl</code>. We can load any value we want into <code>ebx</code> by putting it on
the stack and then letting it get popped into the register. However this
only lets us affect the second least significant byte of <code>edx</code>. Since
<code>edx</code> is also the address of the <code>door</code> buffer, we can also change
<code>door</code> and also <code>edx</code> by changing our stack pointer. Therefore we can
use the same stack trick of returning to main in order to align <code>edx</code>
with the address of system.</p>
<p>Now we need to align our stack pointer with our executable string so
that we can use it as an argument to system. We simply use a ROP NOP
(similar to a ret2ret chain):</p>
<pre><code>    0x080482bb : ret</code></pre>
<p>After a few NOPs, we have that our stack pointer is nearly at the right
spot. We finish our ROP chain with the previously mentioned
<code>call dword ptr [edx]</code>. gets also terminates this with a NUL byte, which
overwrites the LSB of the executable string address. (This is why we
chose a string whose LSB was already 0x00.)</p>
<p>Now we are in a ret2libc scenario: we are calling <code>system</code> with a
pointer to a string on the stack. This runs the program as uid brown,
which allows us to do whatever we want.</p>
<h1 id="stack-canaries">Stack Canaries</h1>
<p>Let’s say that we also add stack canaries. How much more difficult does
this make our exploit?</p>
<p>Debian systems always set the least significant byte of the canary to
0x00, and so we only have 24 bits of entropy. We stay with the constant
guess of 0x41414100 as the stack canary, and simply keep running until
we get that. An efficient C program using syscalls can get on the order
of 2500 tries per second. Based on this, we can estimate that our
program will take approximately 1.2 hours to crack the canary.</p>
<h1 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>The final ropchain is listed in ropchain.py below. The code can be
modified to create the necessary directories and executable
automatically, and to work when stack canaries are enabled.</p>
