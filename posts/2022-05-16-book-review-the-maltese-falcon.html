        <h2>Book Review: The Maltese Falcon</h2>
        <p><i>Tags:</i> <a title="All pages tagged 'reading'." href="../tags/reading.html" rel="tag">reading</a></p>
        <p>Author: Dashiell Hammett</p>
<p>This novel follows private detective Sam Spade as he investigates the
murder of his partner, Miles Archer. The case leads him to the beautiful
and mysterious Brigid O’Shaughnessy, who is in possession of a valuable
jewel-encrusted statue known as the Maltese Falcon. Spade’s
investigation takes him through the seedy underworld of San Francisco,
and ultimately to a confrontation with the novel’s villain, the ruthless
Casper Gutman.</p>
<p>The Maltese Falcon is a classic example of a noir novel, but it is not
without its flaws. The plot is twisty and full of surprises, but it is
also difficult to follow at times. The characters are rich and textured,
but they are also often unlikeable. Both the protaganist Sam Spade and
the antagonist Casper Gutman are entirely unrelatable characters. The
writing is taut and atmospheric, but it is also sometimes choppy and
difficult to read. Overall, the book is a fascinating read, but it is
not perfect.</p>
<p><em>Personal rating</em>: ★★★☆☆</p>
