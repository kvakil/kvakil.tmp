        <h2>Node.js Startup: V8 changes</h2>

        <p>In our <a href="https://kvakil.me/posts/2023-05-22-nodejs-startup-series-removing-code-cache-copies.html">previous post</a>, we made a lot of progress on the Node.js side
towards speeding up initialization. Now it’s time to dive deeper, and see
changes we need to make to V8 itself.</p>
<h2 id="stop-copying-builtins">Stop copying builtins</h2>
<p>Continuing on the theme of the <a href="https://kvakil.me/posts/2023-05-22-nodejs-startup-series-removing-code-cache-copies.html">previous post</a>, I noticed there was still
one more unaddressed large memcpy call.</p>
<p>V8 includes “builtin” functions, which power common Javascript features like
sorting an array. V8 builtins are <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/embedded-builtins">included once in the binary and shared
across different V8 instances via mmap</a>. For <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/short-builtin-calls">performance
reasons</a>, it’s important that the builtin calls are “short jumps” away
from the code generated by V8’s JIT: the generated builtin code should be near
(in terms of virtual memory offsets) the compiled Javascript code to allow for
efficient jumps. However it’s not always possible to ensure that this happens,
so V8’s solution is to copy the builtins to be near the generated Javascript
code when initializing the V8 isolate.</p>
<p>This copying process is expensive since the builtins are quite large (~1.5 MiB
today). Rather than copying the builtins, V8 attempts to mmap the builtins into
the correct place. It parses <code>/proc/self/maps</code> to find out where the binary is
in memory and where the builtins are located in the binary, and then remaps the
binary’s builtins to the correct spot in memory. This means that there are
multiple virtual memory addresses in the process pointing to the same physical
memory address used by the builtins.</p>
<p>Doing this correctly is a little tricky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now we have a file descriptor to the same path the data we want to remap
comes from. But… is it the <em>same</em> file? This is not guaranteed (e.g. in
case of updates), so to avoid hard-to-track bugs, check that the
underlying file is the same using the device number and the inode. Inodes
are not unique across filesystems, and can be reused. The check works
here though, since we have the problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inode uniqueness: check device numbers.</li>
<li>Inode reuse: the initial file is still open, since we are running code
from it. So its inode cannot have been reused.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the code to parse <code>/proc/self/maps</code> was broken in certain cases.
This is what it looked like (<a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main:v8/src/base/platform/platform-linux.cc;drc=e0e0d24aaa54727dc0a8bc4b159ccdf80d3f5d8d;l=141">more context</a>):</p>

<p><code>dev_major</code> and <code>dev_minor</code> are actually not <code>uint8_t</code>: <code>dev_major</code> can use up
to 12 bits and <code>dev_minor</code> can use up to 20 bits. This meant that, depending on
what filesystem the executable was on, V8 would fallback to copying the
builtins when it was not really necessary. Technically using scanf to read an
integer which is too-big is undefined behavior, but in practice implementations
will just silently truncate the conversion.</p>
<p>On my local machine, <code>dev_major</code> was small and the mmaping worked fine. But on
the Amazon EC2 instance I was benchmarking on, the NVMe SSDs have a major
device number of 0x103. That doesn’t fit in a <code>uint8_t</code>, so V8 got confused and
fell back to copying the builtins. The fix was <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4514756">straightforward</a>: I
changed <code>dev_major</code> and <code>dev_minor</code> to be <code>unsigned int</code>, and therefore
speeding up initialization by ~500 microseconds and saving 1.6 MiB of memory.</p>
<p>This is a great example of (1) why you should profile in an environment which
closely matches your “production” environment and (2) why implicit integer
casting in C/C++ is evil. In a language like Rust, where integer casting is
explicit, you would need a cast to correctly type the arguments to <code>makedev</code>
(since <code>makedev</code> takes in two unsigned ints). Hopefully the need for a cast
would tip off the developer that device numbers may actually be bigger than
<code>uint8_t</code>s. (But maybe not! The cast is infallible, which makes it much more
likely to be overlooked.)</p>
<h2 id="stop-recompiling">Stop recompiling</h2>
<p>The next thing <a href="../assets/nodejs-startup-flamegraph.svg?x=435.4&amp;y=404&amp;s=null">I noticed from the flamegraph is that we were spending
time compiling
functions</a>.</p>
<noscript>
Sorry, you need Javascript to view the flamegraph. Do you read this blog
without Javascript? Please email me at <code>ken@kvakil.me</code>.
</noscript>
<p>This was surprising to me. Last time we <a href="https://kvakil.me/posts/2023-05-22-nodejs-startup-series-removing-code-cache-copies.html">learned about the code cache</a>. The
code cache should have eagerly precompiled <em>everything</em>, so we shouldn’t be
compiling <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>Single-stepping through the debugger revealed that the cause was incredibly
simple: the relevant line in the V8 source code was commented out!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">// flags.set_eager(compile_options == ScriptCompiler::kEagerCompile);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Node.js was using the kEagerCompile to ensure that all functions get
compiled and put into the code cache, but it was being ignored. The
default is that V8 uses <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching-for-devs">some heuristics</a> to guess which functions
should be compiled. I <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4571822">uncommented the line</a>, which fixed the
issue. Unfortunately this makes the code cache larger, which makes it
take longer to deserialize and increases its memory footprint. For the
latter issue, it’s a good thing that we’ve removed the extra code cache
copies in our <a href="https://kvakil.me/posts/2023-05-22-nodejs-startup-series-removing-code-cache-copies.html">previous post</a>!</p>
<h2 id="stop-snapshot-checksumming">Stop snapshot checksumming</h2>
<p>While profiling I <a href="../assets/nodejs-startup-flamegraph.svg?s=null&amp;x=340.3&amp;y=212">noticed from the
flamegraph</a>
is that we were spending a decent bit of time running a CRC checksum on
the snapshot.</p>
<p>This checksumming was supposed to only happen in debug modes, but it wasn’t
because the snapshot mode that Node.js used just didn’t have the flag. <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4571989">I added
the flag check in</a>, speeding up startup by another 500 microseconds.</p>
